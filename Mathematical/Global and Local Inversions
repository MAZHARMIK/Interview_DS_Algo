        //We can observe that each local inversion is global inversion (or local inversions are subset of global inversions). For both of them to be equal, every global inversion must only be a local inversion.
        
        //So, if we find any global inversion which is not local inversion, we return false
        
        //Hint : 0 can be placed in either 0th position or 1st position
        //Because if we put it anywhere else we will have more global inversions
        //Similarly, any element can be placed in either i , i-1 or i+1 index only
        
        //For example : 0 1 2 3 -> 1 0 3 2
        //So, abs(A[i]-i) should always be smaller than or equal to 1
        int n = A.size();
